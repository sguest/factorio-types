For performance reasons, we sometimes return a custom table-like type instead of a native Lua table.

Another key difference is that custom tables cannot be serialised into a game save file -- if saving the game would require serialisation of a custom table, an error will be displayed and the game will not be saved.\n\nIn previous versions of Factorio, this would create a [LuaPlayer](runtime:LuaPlayer) instance for every player in the game, even though only one such wrapper is needed. In the current version, accessing [game.players](runtime:LuaGameScript::players) by itself does not create any [LuaPlayer](runtime:LuaPlayer) instances; they are created lazily when accessed. Therefore, this example only constructs one [LuaPlayer](runtime:LuaPlayer) instance, no matter how many elements there are in `game.players`.\n\n```\ngame.players[\"Oxyd\"].character.die()\n```\n\nThis statement will execute successfully and `global.p` will be useable as one might expect.

It is an array where the first element is the key and the remaining elements are parameters that will be substituted for placeholders in the template designated by the key.\n\nThe key identifies the string template. For example, `\"gui-alert-tooltip.attack\"` (for the template `\"__1__ objects are being damaged\"`; see the file `data/core/locale/en.cfg`).\n\nThe template can contain placeholders such as `__1__` or `__2__`. These will be replaced by the respective parameter in the LocalisedString. The parameters themselves can be other localised strings, which will be processed recursively in the same fashion. Localised strings can not be recursed deeper than 20 levels and can not have more than 20 parameters.\n\nThere are two special flags for the localised string, indicated by the key being a particular string. First, if the key is the empty string (`\"\"`), then all parameters will be concatenated (after processing, if any are localised strings themselves). Second, if the key is a question mark (`\"?\"`), then the first valid parameter will be used. A parameter can be invalid if its name doesn't match any string template. If no parameters are valid, the last one is returned. This is useful to implement a fallback for missing locale templates.\n\nFurthermore, when an API function expects a localised string, it will also accept a regular string (i.e. not a table) which will not be translated, as well as a number, boolean or `nil`, which will be converted to their textual representation.","examples":["```\n-- In the English translation, this will print \"No ammo\"; in the Czech translation, it will print \"Bez munice\":\ngame.player.print({\"description.no-ammo\"})\n-- The 'description.no-ammo' template contains no placeholders, so no further parameters are necessary.\n```","```\n-- In the English translation, this will print \"Durability: 5/9\"; in the Japanese one, it will print \"\u8010\u4e45\u5ea6: 5/9\":\ngame.player.print({\"description.durability\", 5, 9})\n```","```\n-- This will print \"hello\" in all translations:\ngame.player.print({\"\", \"hello\"})\n```","```\n-- This will print \"Iron plate: 60\" in the English translation and \"Eisenplatte: 60\" in the German translation.\ngame.print({\"\", {\"item-name.iron-plate\"}, \": \", 60})\n```","```\n-- As an example of a localised string with fallback, consider this:\n{\"?\", {\"\", {\"entity-description.furnace\"}, \"\\n\"}, {\"item-description.furnace\"}, \"optional fallback\"}\n-- If 'entity-description.furnace' exists, it is concatenated with \"\\n\" and returned. Otherwise, if 'item-description.furnace'\n--  exists, it is returned as-is. Otherwise, \"optional fallback\" is returned. If this value wasn't specified, the\n--  translation result would be \"Unknown key: 'item-description.furnace'\".\n```"],"type":{"complex_type":"union","options":["string","number","boolean","LuaObject","nil",{"complex_type":"array","value":"LocalisedString"}],"full_format":false}},{"name":"LogisticFilter","order":157,"description":"","type":{"complex_type":"table","parameters":[{"name":"count","order":2,"description":"The count for this filter.","type":"uint","optional":false},{"name":"index","order":0,"description":"The index this filter applies to.","type":"uint","optional":false},{"name":"name","order":1,"description":"The item name for this filter.","type":"string","optional":false}]}},{"name":"LogisticParameters","order":29,"description":"","type":{"complex_type":"table","parameters":[{"name":"max","order":2,"description":"Defaults to max uint.","type":"uint","optional":true},{"name":"min","order":1,"description":"Defaults to `0`.","type":"uint","optional":true},{"name":"name","order":0,"description":"The item. `nil` clears the filter.","type":"string","optional":true}]}},{"name":"LogisticsNetworkSupplyCounts","order":158,"description":"","type":{"complex_type":"table","parameters":[{"name":"active-provider","order":3,"description":"Number of available items in the active provider members.","type":"uint","optional":false},{"name":"buffer","order":2,"description":"Number of available items in the buffer members.","type":"uint","optional":false},{"name":"passive-provider","order":1,"description":"Number of available items in the passive provider members.","type":"uint","optional":false},{"name":"storage","order":0,"description":"Number of available items in the storage members.","type":"uint","optional":false}]}},{"name":"LogisticsNetworkSupplyPoints","order":159,"description":"","type":{"complex_type":"table","parameters":[{"name":"active-provider","order":3,"description":"","type":{"complex_type":"array","value":"LuaLogisticPoint"},"optional":false},{"name":"buffer","order":2,"description":"","type":{"complex_type":"array","value":"LuaLogisticPoint"},"optional":false},{"name":"passive-provider","order":1,"description":"","type":{"complex_type":"array","value":"LuaLogisticPoint"},"optional":false},{"name":"storage","order":0,"description":"","type":{"complex_type":"array","value":"LuaLogisticPoint"},"optional":false}]}},{"name":"Loot","order":77,"description":"","type":{"complex_type":"table","parameters":[{"name":"count_max","order":3,"description":"Maximum amount of loot to drop.","type":"double","optional":false},{"name":"count_min","order":2,"description":"Minimum amount of loot to drop.","type":"double","optional":false},{"name":"item","order":0,"description":"Item prototype name of the result.","type":"string","optional":false},{"name":"probability","order":1,"description":"Probability that any loot at all will drop, as a number in range [0, 1].","type":"double","optional":false}]}},{"name":"LuaEntityClonedEventFilter","order":221,"description":"","type":{"complex_type":"table","parameters":[{"name":"filter","order":0,"description":"The condition to filter on.","type":{"complex_type":"union","options":[{"complex_type":"literal","value":"type"},{"complex_type":"literal","value":"name"},{"complex_type":"literal","value":"ghost_type"},{"complex_type":"literal","value":"ghost_name"},{"complex_type":"literal","value":"ghost"},{"complex_type":"literal","value":"rail"},{"complex_type":"literal","value":"rail-signal"},{"complex_type":"literal","value":"rolling-stock"},{"complex_type":"literal","value":"robot-with-logistics-interface"},{"complex_type":"literal","value":"vehicle"},{"complex_type":"literal","value":"turret"},{"complex_type":"literal","value":"crafting-machine"},{"complex_type":"literal","value":"wall-connectable"},{"complex_type":"literal","value":"transport-belt-connectable"},{"complex_type":"literal","value":"circuit-network-connectable"}],"full_format":false},"optional":false},{"name":"invert","order":2,"description":"Inverts the condition.
